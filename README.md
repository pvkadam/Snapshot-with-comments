# Snapshot-Algorithm-for-money-transaction
Implementation of Snapshot  algorithm using Socket programming Python.

To Run the code: Open 3 terminals and navigate it to the path where your python files are stored. Each terminal represents each client. Give the command python3 snap_final.py C1 or C2 or C3, depending on which Client you are starting. Then one can capture the state of each client transaction, whether the money is in the channel being transmitted or the money has already reached and is being shown in the balance amount, all these can be captured using the command 'snap' in any terminal. 

Before running the code, create a directory in the same project folder named - outputfiles and create 3 txt files named - snap_1.txt, snap_2.txt, snap_3.txt.
